No Sleep Pro is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that prevents your Mac from sleeping — with a single click.

Whether you're giving a presentation, downloading large files, running a long build, or just want your screen to stay on, No Sleep Pro gives you complete control over when your Mac sleeps.

TIMER PRESETS
Choose from 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, or run indefinitely. Set a custom duration for any length you need. A visual countdown ring in the menu bar shows exactly how much time remains.

SMART AUTOMATION
Set it and forget it. No Sleep Pro can activate automatically based on:
• App Triggers — Stay awake when Zoom, PowerPoint, Keynote, or Chrome is running. Add any app you want.
• Schedules — Define work hours (e.g., 9 AM–5 PM, Mon–Fri) and sleep prevention activates automatically.
• Hardware Triggers — Activate when your power adapter or external display is connected.

CLOSED-LID MODE
Keep your Mac running with the lid closed when connected to an external display and power. Perfect for desktop setups using your MacBook as a workstation.

MOUSE JIGGLER
Prevent "Away" status in Slack, Teams, and other messaging apps. The cursor moves one pixel at configurable intervals — completely invisible during normal use.

BATTERY PROTECTION
No Sleep Pro watches your battery level and automatically stops when it drops below your chosen threshold (10–30%). Your laptop is always protected from draining to zero.

GLOBAL KEYBOARD SHORTCUT
Toggle sleep prevention instantly from any app with a customizable keyboard shortcut. Default: ⌘⇧A.

8 MENU BAR ICON STYLES
Choose from Coffee Cup, Moon, Lightning Bolt, Eye, Sun, Battery, Clock, or Power icons. Pick the one that fits your menu bar aesthetic.

PRIVACY FIRST
No Sleep Pro collects zero data. No analytics, no tracking, no accounts, no network requests. All settings are stored locally on your Mac. Your privacy is absolute.

BUILT FOR macOS
Native SwiftUI app designed exclusively for macOS. Runs in your menu bar with no Dock icon, minimal memory footprint, and instant response times.
